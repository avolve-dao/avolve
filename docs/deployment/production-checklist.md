## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Database & Backend

- [ ] All database migrations have been applied and tested
- [ ] Row Level Security (RLS) policies are enabled and tested for all tables
- [ ] Database indexes are created for frequently queried columns
- [ ] Database functions follow security best practices (SECURITY INVOKER, search_path)
- [ ] Rate limiting is configured for API endpoints and Edge Functions
- [ ] Supabase Realtime is enabled for required tables
- [ ] Database backups are configured and tested
- [ ] Metrics collection is enabled for monitoring

### Frontend & User Experience

- [ ] All pages are responsive and tested on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- [ ] Accessibility compliance checked (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)
- [ ] Loading states and error handling implemented for all async operations
- [ ] Form validation is comprehensive and user-friendly
- [ ] User onboarding flow is tested and optimized
- [ ] Performance optimized (images compressed, code splitting, etc.)
- [ ] SEO metadata is properly configured

### Security

- [ ] Environment variables are properly set and secured
- [ ] Authentication flows are tested (login, signup, password reset)
- [ ] CORS is properly configured
- [ ] CSP (Content Security Policy) is implemented
- [ ] API endpoints validate input and have proper error handling
- [ ] No sensitive data is exposed in client-side code
- [ ] Admin routes are protected

### Testing

- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] End-to-end tests pass
- [ ] Load testing completed (simulate 1000+ concurrent users)
- [ ] Security vulnerability scanning completed

## Deployment Process

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Set up production environment variables
cp .env.example .env.production
# Edit .env.production with production values
```

### 2. Database Preparation

```bash
# Apply all migrations to production database
supabase db push --db-url=<PRODUCTION_DB_URL>

# Verify RLS policies
supabase db verify-policies --db-url=<PRODUCTION_DB_URL>
```

### 3. Build and Deploy

```bash
# Build the application
pnpm build

# Deploy to your hosting platform
# Example for Vercel:
vercel --prod
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Verify all API endpoints are working
- [ ] Test authentication flows in production
- [ ] Verify Realtime functionality
- [ ] Check database connections and query performance
- [ ] Test admin dashboard functionality
- [ ] Verify analytics and monitoring are working

## Scaling Considerations

### For First 100 Users

- Start with basic Supabase plan
- Monitor database query performance
- Collect user feedback aggressively
- Focus on fixing critical bugs quickly

### For 1000+ Users

- Upgrade Supabase plan as needed
- Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Consider implementing a CDN for static assets
- Set up more comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Optimize database queries and indexes based on actual usage patterns

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- Daily/Weekly Active Users (DAU/WAU)
- API response times
- Database query performance
- Error rates
- User engagement metrics (recognition sent/received, etc.)

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

- Weekly database health check
- Monthly security updates
- Bi-weekly feature deployments
- Daily backup verification

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues, follow these steps to rollback:

1. Identify the issue source (database, API, frontend)
2. For frontend issues:
   ```bash
   vercel rollback
   ```
3. For database issues:
   ```bash
   # Rollback to previous migration
   supabase db reset --db-url=<PRODUCTION_DB_URL>
   supabase db push --db-url=<PRODUCTION_DB_URL> --to=<PREVIOUS_MIGRATION>
   ```
4. Communicate with users about the issue and resolution timeline

## Launch Day Checklist

- [ ] Team members have assigned roles (monitoring, support, communications)
- [ ] Support channels are ready and tested
- [ ] Initial batch of invitation codes generated
- [ ] Analytics tracking is verified
- [ ] Social media announcements scheduled
- [ ] Post-launch retrospective meeting scheduled
