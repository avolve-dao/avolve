# Avolve Admin Onboarding Operations Guide

This guide empowers admins to monitor, support, and optimize the onboarding experience for all users.

## Monitoring Onboarding Progress

- Use the **Admin Dashboard** (`/app/(authenticated)/admin`) to view onboarding status for all users.
- Filter by onboarding step, completion status, or user role.

## Intervening & Delegation

- Identify users stuck on a step and reach out directly or assign follow-up to another admin.
- Use the **role management** endpoint to grant onboarding support privileges as needed.

## Automation & Notifications

- Set up notifications for admins when users are stuck or complete onboarding milestones (see [automation setup](./automation.md)).
- Regularly review onboarding analytics for bottlenecks.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

- Ensure all onboarding steps are accessible (keyboard, screen reader, clear language).
- Encourage feedback from diverse users.

## Troubleshooting

- For RBAC or policy issues, see [../database-schema.md](../database-schema.md).
- If you lose admin access, contact another admin or support.
