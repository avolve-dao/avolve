# Avolve Simulation Experiments Log

**Date:** 2025-04-16
**Purpose:** Strategyzer-style validation of Avolve's value proposition and business model using simulation, experimentation, and rapid iteration before inviting real users.

## Experiment Template

| Hypothesis | Test/Experiment | Metric(s) | Success Criteria | Result | Learning | Next Action |
|------------|-----------------|-----------|------------------|--------|----------|-------------|

## Round 1: Initial Hypotheses & Experiments

| Hypothesis | Test/Experiment | Metric(s) | Success Criteria | Result | Learning | Next Action |
|------------|-----------------|-----------|------------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| Daily token claims increase user engagement | Simulate 10 users claiming tokens for 7 days | Claims per user per day; drop-off rate | 80%+ users claim 5+ days |  |  |  |
| Confetti/toasts boost onboarding completion | Simulate onboarding with and without celebration | Onboarding completion rate; user satisfaction | 90%+ completion with celebration |  |  |  |
| Token scarcity motivates more claims | Simulate limited vs. abundant token supply | Claim rates, user feedback | Higher claim rate with scarcity |  |  |  |
| Admins can easily manage tokens and users | Simulate admin flows for minting/transferring tokens, promoting users | Task completion rate, error rate, admin satisfaction | 100% task completion, 0 errors |  |  |  |

## Instructions

1. For each hypothesis, run the described simulation using seeded test users and admin tools/scripts.
2. Fill in the Result, Learning, and Next Action columns after each test.
3. Iterate: Based on learnings, refine hypotheses, design new experiments, and improve the product.
