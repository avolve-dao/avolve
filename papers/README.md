# üìÑ Avolve DAO Papers & Case Studies

Avolve exists to entertain, enlighten, and empower the users and admins of the Regen Supercivilization that exists in parallel to the Degen Anticivilization. This directory is a living archive of real-life experiments, user stories, research papers, and lessons learned from the Avolve DAO journey.

## Purpose
- **Transparency:** Share our research, methodologies, and outcomes openly with the world.
- **Learning:** Capture what works, what doesn‚Äôt, and why‚Äîso the DAO and community can continually evolve.
- **Inspiration:** Showcase the impact of Avolve through authentic stories and data.

## What You'll Find Here
- **Case Studies:** Deep dives into real-world user journeys, onboarding experiments, and transformation stories.
- **Experiment Logs:** Documentation of live experiments, including hypotheses, methods, results, and learnings.
- **Research Papers:** Theoretical and applied research related to regenerative tokenomics, governance, and community building.
- **Lessons Learned:** Honest reflections and actionable insights from both successes and failures.

## How Avolve Works
Avolve is built around three main values:
- **Superachiever:** For the individual journey of transformation.
- **Superachievers:** For the collective journey of transformation.
- **Supercivilization:** For the ecosystem journey of transformation.

The storyline: Civilization is shaped by mentality. Most people are Degens‚Äîfollowers who sustain the Anticivilization (a zero-sum world ruled by value usurpers). Some are Regens‚Äîself-leaders and value creators who co-create the Supercivilization (a positive-sum world for all). The name of the game is to evolve from Degen to Regen, faster, by creating your Success Puzzle (for personal lifestyle) and co-creating our Superpuzzle (for collective living).
