## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Testing

### Running Locally

```sh
pnpm dev
```

### Building for Production

```sh
pnpm build
```

### Testing

Avolve uses a streamlined testing approach focused on Next.js, Vercel, and Supabase:

```sh
# Run all tests
pnpm test:all

# Run specific test types
pnpm test:unit        # Unit tests
pnpm test:integration # Integration tests
pnpm test:e2e         # End-to-End tests with Playwright
pnpm test:security    # Security tests
pnpm test:api         # API endpoint tests
pnpm test:accessibility # Accessibility tests
```

Our testing strategy includes:

- **Unit Tests**: Core business logic using Jest
- **Integration Tests**: API and component integration
- **E2E Tests**: User flows with Playwright
- **Security Tests**: RLS policies and middleware protections
- **Accessibility Tests**: WCAG compliance checks

> Note: Ensure Docker Desktop is running for local Supabase tests.

### Linting & Formatting

```sh
pnpm lint
pnpm exec prettier --write .
```
