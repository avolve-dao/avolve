# SCQ — Superachievers

The SCQ token represents the collective journey of transformation on Avolve. This paper explores how groups, teams, and communities co-create value and drive regenerative change together.

## Collective Journey
Avolve enables collectives to design and achieve Superpuzzles—ambitious, shared goals that require collaboration, coordination, and shared purpose. The SCQ layer bridges individual transformation (SAP) with ecosystem impact (GEN).
