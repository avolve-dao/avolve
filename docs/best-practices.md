# Avolve Best Practices

This document outlines the best practices implemented in the Avolve codebase. It serves as a guide for current and future developers to understand the architectural decisions, coding standards, and security practices used throughout the application.

## API Security Best Practices

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is implemented to protect API endpoints from abuse and ensure fair usage of resources.

**Implementation Details:**
- Located in `/lib/rate-limit.ts`
- Uses an in-memory store for serverless environments
- Configurable window (default: 60 seconds) and request limit (default: 10 requests)
- Identifies clients by IP address and requested path
- Returns appropriate headers for client-side handling

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
import { rateLimit } from "@/lib/rate-limit"

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  // Apply rate limiting
  const rateLimitResult = await rateLimit(req)
  if (!rateLimitResult.success) {
    return new Response(rateLimitResult.message, { 
      status: 429,
      headers: rateLimitResult.headers 
    })
  }
  
  // Continue processing the request...
}
```

**Best Practices:**
- Always apply rate limiting to public-facing API endpoints
- Include rate limit headers in all responses
- Consider different limits for different endpoint types
- In production, consider using a distributed rate limiting solution (Redis, etc.)

### Caching

Caching is implemented to improve performance and reduce load on backend services.

**Implementation Details:**
- Located in `/lib/cache.ts`
- Uses LRU cache with configurable max size and TTL
- Generates cache keys based on request method, path, and body
- Provides utilities for getting, setting, and invalidating cached responses

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
import { generateCacheKey, getCachedResponse, setCachedResponse } from "@/lib/cache"

// Generate a cache key for the current request
const cacheKey = generateCacheKey(req)

// Try to get a cached response
const cachedResponse = getCachedResponse(cacheKey)
if (cachedResponse) {
  return cachedResponse
}

// Generate and cache a new response
const response = await generateResponse()
setCachedResponse(cacheKey, response)
return response
```

**Best Practices:**
- Cache only idempotent operations (GET, POST with same input = same output)
- Set appropriate TTL values based on data volatility
- Include cache bypass mechanisms for fresh data requirements
- Implement cache invalidation for related data changes
- Consider cache poisoning vectors when designing cache keys

### Input Validation

Robust input validation is implemented to ensure data integrity and prevent security vulnerabilities.

**Implementation Details:**
- Located in `/lib/validators/`
- Uses Zod for schema validation
- Provides both strict validation (throws errors) and safe validation (returns result object)
- Includes detailed error information for debugging

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
import { safeValidateChatRequest } from "@/lib/validators/chat"

// Parse and validate request body
const body = await req.json()
const validation = safeValidateChatRequest(body)

if (!validation.success) {
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ 
    error: "Invalid request", 
    details: validation.error?.errors 
  }), { status: 400 })
}

// Use validated data
const { messages, model } = validation.data
```

**Best Practices:**
- Validate all user input at the application boundary
- Use strict types for internal functions
- Return descriptive validation errors to aid debugging
- Avoid manual validation in favor of schema-based validation
- Keep validation schemas in sync with TypeScript types

### Security Headers

Security headers are implemented to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

**Implementation Details:**
- Located in `/lib/security-headers.ts`
- Configurable options for different header combinations
- Utilities for applying headers to existing responses
- Sensible defaults for all headers

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
import { withSecurityHeaders } from "@/lib/security-headers"

// Apply security headers to a response
const response = new Response("Hello World")
const secureResponse = withSecurityHeaders(response)

// Or create a new response with security headers
const headers = createSecurityHeaders()
const response = new Response("Hello World", { headers })
```

**Best Practices:**
- Apply security headers to all responses
- Use appropriate Content Security Policy directives
- Enable Strict Transport Security in production
- Review and update security headers regularly
- Test security headers with tools like Mozilla Observatory

## Structured Logging

Structured logging is implemented to improve debugging, monitoring, and observability.

**Implementation Details:**
- Located in `/lib/logger.ts`
- Supports multiple log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Includes contextual information with each log entry
- Environment-aware configuration

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
import { logger } from "@/lib/logger"

// Basic logging
logger.info("Processing request")
logger.error("Failed to process request", error)

// Contextual logging
const routeLogger = logger.withContext({ route: "api/chat" })
routeLogger.info("Processing chat request", { messageCount: 5 })
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use appropriate log levels for different information
- Include relevant context with each log entry
- Avoid logging sensitive information
- Create context-specific loggers for related operations
- In production, consider sending logs to a centralized service

## Error Handling

Consistent error handling is implemented to improve user experience and debugging.

**Implementation Details:**
- Standardized error responses across all API endpoints
- Detailed error information in development, sanitized in production
- Structured logging of all errors with context

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
try {
  // Operation that might fail
} catch (error) {
  logger.error("Operation failed", error, { context: "additional info" })
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ 
    error: "Something went wrong" 
  }), { status: 500 })
}
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use try/catch blocks for error-prone operations
- Log all errors with appropriate context
- Return user-friendly error messages
- Include error codes for programmatic handling
- Don't expose internal error details in production

## API Design Principles

The Avolve API follows these design principles:

1. **Consistency**: All endpoints follow the same patterns for requests, responses, and error handling
2. **Security First**: Security considerations are built into the API design from the start
3. **Performance**: Caching and optimization techniques are used to ensure fast responses
4. **Developer Experience**: Clear documentation and predictable behavior improve developer experience
5. **Robustness**: Comprehensive validation and error handling make the API resilient

## Future Considerations

As the application grows, consider these additional best practices:

1. **Distributed Caching**: Replace in-memory cache with Redis or similar for multi-instance deployments
2. **API Versioning**: Implement explicit versioning for breaking changes
3. **Metrics Collection**: Add performance metrics collection for monitoring
4. **Circuit Breakers**: Implement circuit breakers for external service calls
5. **Correlation IDs**: Add request correlation IDs for tracing requests across services
