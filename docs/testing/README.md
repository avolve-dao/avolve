# Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Avolve platform, covering unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

## Test Types

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components and functions in isolation.

#### Key Areas
- API route handlers
- Database queries and mutations
- Utility functions
- React components
- Token system functions

#### Tools
- Vitest for test runner
- React Testing Library for component tests
- MSW for API mocking
- vi.mock for dependency mocking

#### Example
```typescript
import { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest';
import { GET } from '../route';

describe('API Route Handler', () => {
  it('should handle successful request', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different parts of the system work together correctly.

#### Key Areas
- API endpoints with database
- Authentication flows
- Token system integration
- Event handling system

#### Tools
- Supertest for API testing
- Test database for data persistence
- JWT token handling

#### Example
```typescript
describe('Token System Integration', () => {
  it('should transfer tokens between users', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### 3. End-to-End Tests

E2E tests verify the entire application flow from the user's perspective.

#### Key Areas
- User journeys
- Critical paths
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile responsiveness

#### Tools
- Playwright for browser automation
- Visual regression testing
- Performance monitoring

#### Example
```typescript
test('complete user onboarding flow', async ({ page }) => {
  // Test implementation
});
```

## Test Organization

### Directory Structure
```
tests/
├── unit/              # Unit tests
├── integration/       # Integration tests
├── e2e/              # End-to-end tests
└── __mocks__/        # Mock implementations
```

### Naming Conventions
- Files: `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`
- Test suites: Describe the module/component
- Test cases: Describe the scenario

## Best Practices

1. **Test Coverage**
   - Aim for 80% code coverage
   - Focus on critical paths
   - Include edge cases

2. **Test Independence**
   - Each test should be self-contained
   - Clean up test data
   - Reset mocks between tests

3. **Test Data**
   - Use factories for test data
   - Avoid hard-coded values
   - Document data dependencies

4. **Mocking**
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Use realistic mock data
   - Document mock behavior

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: Test
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: pnpm test
```

### Test Environments
- Development: Local tests
- Staging: Integration tests
- Production: Smoke tests

## Monitoring and Reporting

1. **Coverage Reports**
   - Generated after each test run
   - Tracked in CI/CD pipeline
   - Published to dashboard

2. **Test Results**
   - JUnit XML format
   - GitHub Actions annotations
   - Team notifications

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Test execution time
   - API response times
   - Browser performance
