# 📄 Avolve DAO Papers & Case Studies

> **Avolve is the site/app with 3 main values:**
>
> - **Superachiever** for the individual journey of transformation.
> - **Superachievers** for the collective journey of transformation.
> - **Supercivilization** for the ecosystem journey of transformation.
>
> **The storyline:** Civilization is based on mankind’s mentality. Most people are Degens stuck in a following mode mentality, enabling the Anticivilization with its parasitical elite ruling class of bad people (value destroyers and usurpers). Some people are Regens—self-leaders, integrated thinkers, and value creators/producers. They are the good (value producers) and great (value creators) people who benefit themselves, others, society, and the environment. The Degen Anticivilization is a zero-sum game. The Regen Supercivilization is a positive-sum game. The name of the game is to further Avolve from Degen to Regen faster by creating your success puzzle for a better individual quality of lifestyle, and co-creating our superpuzzle for a better collective standard of living.

Avolve exists to entertain, enlighten, and empower the users and admins of the Regen Supercivilization that exists in parallel to the Degen Anticivilization. This directory is a living archive of real-life experiments, user stories, research papers, and lessons learned from the Avolve DAO journey.

## Purpose
- **Transparency:** Share our research, methodologies, and outcomes openly with the world.
- **Learning:** Capture what works, what doesn’t, and why—so the DAO and community can continually evolve.
- **Inspiration:** Showcase the impact of Avolve through authentic stories and data.

## What You'll Find Here
- **Case Studies:** Deep dives into real-world user journeys, onboarding experiments, and transformation stories.
- **Experiment Logs:** Documentation of live experiments, including hypotheses, methods, results, and learnings.
- **Research Papers:** Theoretical and applied research related to regenerative tokenomics, fractal/meritocratic/sociocratic governance, and community building.
- **Lessons Learned:** Honest reflections and actionable insights from both successes and failures.

## How Avolve Works
Avolve is built around three main values:
- **Superachiever:** For the individual journey of transformation.
- **Superachievers:** For the collective journey of transformation.

## 🧪 Experiments: Accelerating Success, Co-Creation, and Regeneration

Avolve is a living laboratory for transformation at every scale. Our experiments are designed to:

- **Individual Superachiever Experiments:** Empower individuals to create their personal success puzzle faster—through new tools, mindsets, and peer learning.
- **Collective Superachievers Experiments:** Enable groups to co-create our superpuzzle faster—solving foundational and moonshot problems for individuals, collectives, and the ecosystem.
- **Supercivilization Ecosystem Experiments:** Advance Avolve from surviving/striving (Degen Mentality/Anticivilization) to thriving (Regen Mentality/Supercivilization) sooner than later, for the benefit of all.

Each experiment is documented with clear hypotheses, methods, results, and learnings. We invite you to explore, contribute, and propose new experiments that further our journey from Degen to Regen.

See the [Avolve DAO Experiment Registry](./experiments.md) for a living index of all major experiments, pilots, and research studies.
