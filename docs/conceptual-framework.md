## Application Structure

The Avolve application structure directly mirrors this conceptual framework:

- The `/app/(superachiever)/` routes handle individual transformation journeys
- The `/app/(superachievers)/` routes handle collective transformation journeys
- The `/app/(supercivilization)/` routes handle ecosystem-level transformation

Each section provides specialized tools, resources, and communities aligned with its specific focus area.

## User Journey

1. Users begin their journey by creating a Genius ID within the Supercivilization ecosystem
2. They can then explore their individual transformation through the Superachiever pathways
3. As they progress, they can join collective transformation efforts through the Superachievers communities
4. Eventually, they contribute to the broader ecosystem transformation through Supercivilization initiatives

This multi-layered approach ensures that users can find value at every stage of their personal and collective growth journey.
