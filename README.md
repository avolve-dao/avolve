## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration & Project Structure (2025 Launch)

Avolve is designed for maintainability, clarity, and DRY principles. Below is an overview of essential configuration files and best practices for a clean, production-ready setup.

### Essential Config Files

| File/Dir                       | Purpose / Notes                                   |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `.env.example`                 | Template for environment variables. Keep up-to-date and minimal. |
| `.gitignore`                   | Ignore sensitive or build files.                  |
| `.lintstagedrc.js`             | Pre-commit linting.                               |
| `eslint.config.js`             | Unified ESLint config (see note below).           |
| `next.config.mjs`              | Main Next.js config (ESM, supports user overrides).|
| `postcss.config.mjs`           | PostCSS config for Tailwind, etc.                 |
| `tailwind.config.js`           | Tailwind CSS config.                              |
| `tsconfig.json`                | Base TypeScript config.                           |
| `tsconfig.node.json`           | Node-specific TS config (extends base).           |
| `tsconfig.sim.json`            | Simulation/test TS config (extends base).         |
| `pnpm-lock.yaml`               | Lock file for pnpm (remove package-lock.json).    |
| `vitest.config.ts`             | Vitest (test runner) config.                      |
| `vercel.json`                  | Vercel deployment config.                         |
| `config/ai-state.json`         | Custom AI/app config (documented below).          |
| `supabase/config.toml`         | Supabase CLI config.                              |
| `supabase/migrations/`         | All DB migrations (source of truth).              |
| `supabase/schemas/`            | Modular SQL schemas (merge with /schema/ if needed). |
| `supabase/functions/`          | Edge/database functions.                          |
| `supabase/seed/`               | Seed data for onboarding/tests.                   |
| `types/`                       | TypeScript types (auto-gen and manual).           |

#### Notes:
- **Deprecated:** `.eslintrc.json` and `next.config.js` are stubs for compatibility. Use `eslint.config.js` and `next.config.mjs`.
- **Remove:** `package-lock.json` if using pnpm.
- **Merge:** `supabase/schema/` into `supabase/schemas/` if possible.
- **Document:** All custom configs (e.g. `config/ai-state.json`) in this README.

### Example: Custom AI Config

The file `config/ai-state.json` tracks the state of major product subsystems, their implementation status, and key code locations. This is used for onboarding, automated documentation, and AI assistant optimizations.

**Structure:**
- `version`: Config version
- `lastUpdated`: ISO8601 timestamp
- `codebaseState`: Object with keys for each subsystem (tokenSystem, journeySystem, etc.), each containing:
  - `status`: Implementation status (e.g., "complete")
  - `description`: Short description
  - `components`, `utilities`, `apiRoutes`: Arrays of objects with `name`, `status`, and `path`
- `featureFlags`: Feature toggles for major platform features
- `aiAssistantOptimizations`: Toggles for AI/automation enhancements (semantic anchors, type definitions, etc.)

**See:** [`config/ai-state.json`](./config/ai-state.json) for the current state and documentation of all major systems.

### DRY & Maintainable Practices
- **Single Source of Truth:** Only one config per tool (see above table).
- **Extends:** Use `extends` in TS configs for variants (e.g., node, sim).
- **Modular SQL:** Use `/supabase/schemas/` and reference in migrations for DRYness.
- **Onboarding:** Keep `.env.example` and this README up-to-date for new contributors.
- **Automation:** Use scripts in `/scripts/` for checks and setup.

### Example: Environment Variables
See `.env.example` for the minimal set of required variables. Document each in the table above for clarity.

### Example: ESLint
All lint rules are now in `eslint.config.js` (flat config, supports plugins and custom rules). `.eslintrc.json` is deprecated and left as a stub.

### Example: Next.js Config
All Next.js configuration is in `next.config.mjs` (ESM, supports user overrides). `next.config.js` is deprecated and left as a stub.

### Example: Supabase Schema
All DB schema and policy changes should be made in `/supabase/migrations/` and, if modular, in `/supabase/schemas/`. Document any custom logic in `/supabase/README.md`.

|------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| id               | uuid        | Primary key                                     |
| user_id          | uuid        | References `auth.users(id)`                     |
| completed_steps  | text[]      | Array of completed onboarding step keys         |
| completed_at     | timestamptz | Timestamp when onboarding was fully completed   |
| created_at       | timestamptz | Row creation timestamp                          |
| updated_at       | timestamptz | Last update timestamp                           |

- **Row Level Security:** Only the user (and admins) can view or update their onboarding row.
- **Admin Controls:** Admins can view and manage onboarding progress for all users.

### Onboarding Automation, Recognition, and Admin Dashboard

### Automated Onboarding Reminders
- A Supabase Edge Function (`send_onboarding_reminders.ts`) automatically notifies users who are stuck in onboarding.
- Reminders are logged in the `user_notifications` table for full auditability.
- Admins can trigger reminders manually from the Admin Dashboard for any user.
- All reminder flows are secured by Row Level Security (RLS) and role checks.

### Recognition & Gratitude System
- Admins receive recognition (gratitude events) when they assist users in completing onboarding.
- Gratitude events are logged in the `gratitude_events` table and surfaced in the Admin Dashboard.

### Admin Dashboard Features
- **Gratitude Feed:** See recent recognitions for your admin support.
- **Stuck Onboarding Table:** View users who are stuck in onboarding, with last progress and last reminder sent.
- **Manual Reminder Buttons:** Send reminders directly to users from the dashboard.
- All dashboard features are modular, secure, and production-ready for launch.

### Security & Best Practices
- All onboarding and recognition flows are protected by RLS and RBAC.
- All new features are documented and maintainable, following Supabase and Next.js best practices.
- Codebase is optimized for a clean, welcoming, and robust initial launch experience.

For details on onboarding, recognition, and admin empowerment, see also:
- [`supabase/functions/send_onboarding_reminders.ts`](./supabase/functions/send_onboarding_reminders.ts)
- [`components/admin/GratitudeFeed.tsx`](./components/admin/GratitudeFeed.tsx)
- [`components/admin/StuckOnboardingTable.tsx`](./components/admin/StuckOnboardingTable.tsx)
- [`app/(authenticated)/admin/page.tsx`](./app/(authenticated)/admin/page.tsx)

### Security and Data Integrity
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** on all user data tables
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for admin actions
- **Token gating** for advanced features
- **Audit Fields:** All tables have `created_at` and `updated_at` for traceability
- **Indexes:** All foreign keys and frequently queried columns are indexed for performance
- All data is live, real, and production-grade

**See:** [Database Docs](./docs/database.md)

### Node.js 22, Vercel, and Supabase Requirements

- Node.js 22.x is required for all development and production environments. See `package.json` for explicit version.
- All deployments use Vercel. Logs are accessible via the Vercel dashboard (see below).
- All database operations, authentication, and RBAC are managed via Supabase. Logs for queries and auth events are available in the Supabase dashboard.
- All audit fields (`created_at`, `updated_at`) are kept up-to-date with triggers (see latest migrations).

### Accessing Logs
- **Vercel:** Go to your Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Logs. Filter by `console.error`, `console.info`, or custom JSON keys for structured logs.
- **Supabase:** Go to your Supabase dashboard ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Logs. Filter by query, auth, or function logs as needed.

### Security

- **Secrets & Environment Variables**: All sensitive keys (Supabase, API keys, etc.) are stored in environment variables and never committed to the repo. Ensure your `.env*` files are never tracked by git (see `.gitignore`).
- **Reporting Vulnerabilities**: If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately to the maintainers. Do not open a public issue.
- **RLS & Database Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled on all tables. Policies are granular and reviewed regularly for least-privilege access.
