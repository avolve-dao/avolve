## Abstract
This living paper documents the real-time evolution of onboarding at Avolve‚Äîa platform and movement dedicated to accelerating the journey from ‚ÄúDegen‚Äù (follower in a zero-sum Anticivilization) to ‚ÄúRegen‚Äù (self-leader and value creator in a positive-sum Supercivilization). Avolve‚Äôs onboarding is the gateway to a three-pillar transformation: Superachiever (individual), Superachievers (collective), and Supercivilization (ecosystem). By integrating gamified ‚Äúsuccess puzzles‚Äù and ‚Äúsuperpuzzles,‚Äù Avolve empowers users to enhance their quality of life and co-create a regenerative future. Our approach, grounded in data and community feedback, aims to set a new standard for DAO onboarding‚Äîinviting all to join the Regeneration Awakening and help build a better civilization for all.

## Introduction
Civilization is shaped by the mentality of its people. In today‚Äôs world, most are ‚ÄúDegens‚Äù‚Äîlocked in a following-mode that sustains the Anticivilization, marked by zero-sum competition and value usurpation by the few. Avolve exists to entertain, enlighten, and empower the users and admins of the Regen Supercivilization that exists in parallel to the Degen Anticivilization. Avolve‚Äôs mission is to awaken and empower ‚ÄúRegens‚Äù‚Äîself-leaders, integrated thinkers, and value creators‚Äîwho drive the shift to a positive-sum Supercivilization. Through the lens of the Superachiever (individual), Superachievers (collective), and Supercivilization (ecosystem), Avolve‚Äôs onboarding is designed to catalyze this transformation, guiding users to build their personal and collective ‚Äúsuccess puzzles‚Äù and ‚Äúsuperpuzzles‚Äù for a better world.

Avolve‚Äôs intention is to further the evolution from Degen to Regen, faster and together, by enabling individuals to create their own success puzzle for a better quality of life, and collectives to co-create the superpuzzle for a better standard of living. The onboarding process is not merely an entry-point, but an invitation to join the Regeneration Awakening, relieve the pains of the Anticivilization, and co-create the gains of the Supercivilization‚Äîanchored in the platform‚Äôs three main values:

- **Superachiever**: For the individual journey of transformation.
- **Superachievers**: For the collective journey of transformation.
- **Supercivilization**: For the ecosystem journey of transformation.

Avolve‚Äôs narrative and architecture are further structured by:
- **One Focus:** Supercivilization (GEN token)
- **Two Views:** Superachiever & Superachievers
- **Three Keys:** Personal Success Puzzle (PSP), Business Success Puzzle (BSP), Supermind Superpowers (SMS)
- **Four Cores:** Superpuzzle Developments (SPD), Superhuman Enhancements (SHE), Supersociety Advancements (SSA), Supergenius Breakthroughs (SBG)

## Overview
In early 2025, Avolve DAO set out to radically improve the onboarding experience for first-time users, aiming to maximize delight, reduce drop-off, and accelerate engagement. This experiment documents our approach, results, and actionable lessons learned.

## Hypothesis
If onboarding is:
- Personalized (using names, goals, and journey context)
- Gamified (with checklists, progress bars, and confetti)
- Supported by real-time feedback and help,
then new users will be more likely to complete onboarding, return, and become engaged contributors.

## Method
- **Cohorts:** 500 new users were invited via unique codes over 4 weeks.
- **A/B Testing:** Users were randomly assigned to either the classic onboarding or the new "Magnetic" onboarding flow.
- **Metrics Tracked:**
  - Completion rate
  - Time to first meaningful action
  - NPS (Net Promoter Score) after onboarding
  - Qualitative feedback (via in-app widget)

## Results
| Metric                       | Classic Onboarding | Magnetic Onboarding |
|------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Completion Rate              | 68%                | 91%                |
| Median Time to First Action  | 2.6 days           | 0.9 days           |
| NPS (post-onboarding)        | +11                | +54                |
| Qualitative Feedback         | "Confusing"        | "Fun, clear, motivating!" |

## Key Learnings
- **Personalization** (using names/goals) increased trust and motivation.
- **Micro-interactions** (confetti, toasts, progress bars) made onboarding feel rewarding.
- **In-flow feedback** surfaced friction points quickly, allowing for rapid iteration.
- **Mobile-first design** was critical: 67% of new users joined via mobile.

## Supporting Data
- See [`/data/onboarding-2025.json`](../data/onboarding-2025.json) for anonymized metrics.
- Governance logs for this experiment are in [`/data/governance-logs-2025.json`](../data/governance-logs-2025.json).

## Next Steps
- Roll out "Magnetic" onboarding to all new users.
- Extend personalization to returning users and admins.
- Continue rapid, feedback-driven iteration.
