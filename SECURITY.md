## Best Practices

- Never commit secrets or credentials to the repository.
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration.
- Keep dependencies up to date and monitor for vulnerabilities.
- Require 2FA and branch protection for all contributors.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

- We aim to acknowledge all reports within 2 business days.
- Critical vulnerabilities will be patched as soon as possible, with public disclosure after resolution.
