## Your Value Journey

The Avolve platform offers multiple paths to value creation, each optimized for different goals and preferences.

### Journey Selection Guide

When selecting your journey during onboarding, consider these optimized paths:

1. **SAP (Superachiever) Focus**:

   - Best for: Individual growth and personal development
   - Quick wins: Complete PSP challenges (Tuesdays) for immediate health and wealth improvements
   - Unlock path: Prioritize personal metrics to unlock advanced self-improvement tools
   - Time commitment: 5-10 minutes daily, focused on personal reflection and action

2. **SCQ (Superachievers) Focus**:

   - Best for: Community building and collective advancement
   - Quick wins: Complete SSA challenges (Wednesdays) for immediate community contribution
   - Unlock path: Prioritize community engagement to access governance features
   - Time commitment: 10-15 minutes daily, with emphasis on collaboration and feedback

3. **Balanced Approach**:
   - Best for: Holistic growth across individual and collective domains
   - Quick wins: Alternate between PSP and SSA challenges
   - Unlock path: Progress evenly across metrics to access integrated features
   - Time commitment: 15-20 minutes daily, distributed across personal and community activities

### Token Optimization Strategy

To maximize your token earnings and platform value:

1. **Tuesday-Wednesday Combo**: Focus on PSP (Tuesday) and SSA (Wednesday) for the most efficient token acquisition strategy

   - PSP tokens unlock personal development tools
   - SSA tokens provide community influence and governance rights
   - This combination accelerates both individual and collective progress

2. **Streak Prioritization**: If time is limited, prioritize maintaining your SSA streak on Wednesdays

   - The 3-6-9 multiplier system makes consistent participation more valuable than occasional intensive engagement
   - A 9-day SSA streak (1.9x multiplier) generates nearly twice the value of baseline participation

3. **Value Feedback Loop**: Use the "Worth Your Time?" toggle to help us optimize your experience
   - Activities consistently rated as valuable receive development priority
   - Your feedback directly shapes the platform's evolution

## Earning Tokens and Streaks

The Avolve platform uses a streak system based on Tesla's 3-6-9 pattern to reward consistent participation.

### How Streaks Work

1. **Daily Streaks**: Each time you complete a daily challenge for a specific token, your streak for that token increases by 1
2. **Weekly Streaks**: Each time you complete a weekly challenge, your weekly streak for that token increases by 1
3. **Streak Reset**: If you miss a day, your streak for that token resets to 0
4. **Streak Bonuses**: As your streak grows, you earn increasingly larger bonuses

### Tesla's 3-6-9 Streak Bonus System

The Avolve platform implements Nikola Tesla's sacred geometry pattern of 3-6-9 to calculate streak bonuses:

| Streak Length | Bonus Multiplier      | Example Reward (10 base tokens) |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1-2 days      | 1.0x (no bonus)       | 10 tokens                       |
| 3-5 days      | 1.3x bonus            | 13 tokens                       |
| 6-8 days      | 1.6x bonus            | 16 tokens                       |
| 9+ days       | 1.9x bonus            | 19 tokens                       |
| 12+ days      | 2.3x bonus            | 23 tokens                       |
| 15+ days      | 2.6x bonus            | 26 tokens                       |
| 18+ days      | 2.9x bonus            | 29 tokens                       |
| 21+ days      | 3.3x bonus and higher | 33+ tokens                      |

The pattern continues with a 0.3x increase for each additional 3 days in your streak.

### Tips for Maximizing Your Streak Bonuses

1. **Plan for 9 Days**: The biggest milestone is at 9 days, where you'll earn a 1.9x multiplier
2. **Set Daily Reminders**: Schedule a daily reminder to complete your challenges
3. **Batch Complete When Necessary**: If you know you'll be unavailable, complete challenges in advance
4. **Focus on One Token**: If you can't complete all challenges, prioritize maintaining your longest streak
5. **Track Your Progress**: Use the Tesla's 3-6-9 spiral visualization on your dashboard to see your progress
6. **Aim for Consistency**: Even a small daily action maintains your streak and compounds over time
7. **Recover Quickly**: If you miss a day, don't get discouraged—start again immediately

### Visualizing Your Streaks

The challenge dashboard features a Tesla's 3-6-9 spiral visualization that grows as your streak increases. The spiral changes color at key milestones:

- **1-2 days**: Gray spiral
- **3-5 days**: Blue spiral
- **6-8 days**: Green spiral
- **9+ days**: Gold spiral with increasing brightness

The "Next Bonus" countdown shows you how many more days until you reach your next streak milestone and the corresponding bonus multiplier you'll receive.

A: The Tesla 3-6-9 system provides increasing rewards as your streak grows:
