> **Narrative Context:**
> Avolve's collective journey is to co-create a Regen Supercivilization through fractal, meritocratic, and sociocratic governance. This living paper documents how circles, roles, peer review, and reputation systems replace token-weighted voting, supporting the evolution from Degen to Regen and the emergence of a Network State.

## Abstract
This paper documents the theory and practice of fractal, meritocratic, and sociocratic governance in Avolve. We describe how circles, roles, peer review, and reputation systems are used to build a parallel society of Superachievers, and how these methods support the evolution from Degen to Regen and the emergence of a Network State. Token-weighted voting is not used; instead, we focus on positive-sum, peer-driven decision-making inspired by Fractally and other regenerative models.
