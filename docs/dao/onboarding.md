# ðŸš€ Avolve DAO Onboarding Guide

_Welcome to the Avolve DAO!_

This guide will help new contributors, admins, and future DAO members understand how to get started, contribute, and participate in the governance and evolution of the Avolve platform.

## 1. Vision & Values
- **Transform Yourself, Transform the World:** Avolve empowers individuals and communities to evolve through a token-based, gamified ecosystem.
- **DAO Ownership:** The platform is governed by the Avolve DAO, with a clear roadmap to full decentralization.

## 2. Getting Started
- **Read the [README](../README.md) and [DAO Governance Guide](./governance.md).**
- **Set up your development environment** (see project README for instructions).
- **Familiarize yourself with the [database schema](../database/schema.md)** and migration process.

## 3. How to Contribute
- Propose changes via Pull Request (PR) following the [Schema Changes Guide](./schema-changes.md).
- All changes are reviewed by the DAO steward (Joshua Seymour) and/or DAO members.
- As the DAO matures, community voting will be enabled for proposals.

## 4. Community & Support
- For questions, contact admin@avolve.io.
- Join the DAO community to participate in governance and platform evolution.
