# üèõÔ∏è Avolve DAO Governance Guide

_Last updated: 2025-04-15_

## Introduction

Avolve DAO is the steward and ultimate authority for the Avolve platform, its codebase, database schema, and all related assets. The DAO is currently led by its founder, Joshua Seymour, as benevolent dictator, with a clear and explicit goal to transition to fully decentralized, community-driven governance.

## Governance Structure

- **Benevolent Dictatorship (Current):** Joshua Seymour acts as steward, making final decisions to ensure rapid progress and alignment with the Avolve vision.
- **DAO Maturity (Goal):** Over time, governance will transition to on-chain voting, community proposals, and collective decision-making.
- **Transparency:** All proposals, schema changes, and major decisions are tracked publicly in the codebase and documentation.

## How Governance Works

1. **Proposing Changes:**
   - Any contributor can propose a change (code, schema, docs) via Pull Request (PR).
   - Major changes should include a rationale and impact summary.
2. **Review & Approval:**
   - PRs are reviewed by Joshua Seymour and/or designated DAO reviewers.
   - Once the DAO matures, PRs will require community approval via on-chain or off-chain voting.
3. **Merging & Deployment:**
   - Approved PRs are merged and deployed according to CI/CD best practices.
   - All schema changes are versioned and auditable.

## Transition to Full DAO Governance

- **Roadmap:**
  - Develop on-chain voting and proposal system.
  - Gradually decentralize decision-making power.
  - Empower the community to manage all platform assets and direction.
