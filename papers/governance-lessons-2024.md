# üèõÔ∏è DAO Governance: Real-World Lessons from Token Voting (2024)

## Overview
In 2024, Avolve DAO conducted a series of governance experiments using token-weighted voting and transparent proposal processes. This case study captures the real-world outcomes, challenges, and actionable insights for DAOs seeking effective, inclusive governance.

## Experiment Design
- **Token Voting:** GEN, SAP, and SCQ token holders could vote on proposals, with weights proportional to holdings.
- **Open Proposals:** Any verified member could submit a proposal; all proposals were publicly logged.
- **Feedback Loop:** In-app feedback and Discord channels were used for real-time discussion.

## Key Metrics
- Proposal participation rate
- Voter turnout by token type
- Proposal approval rate
- Average time from proposal to execution

## Results
| Metric                        | Value         |
|-------------------------------|--------------|
| Proposal Participation Rate   | 74%           |
| Voter Turnout (GEN)           | 62%           |
| Voter Turnout (SAP)           | 54%           |
| Voter Turnout (SCQ)           | 49%           |
| Proposal Approval Rate        | 67%           |
| Avg. Proposal ‚Üí Execution     | 4.2 days      |

## Lessons Learned
- **Transparency** (public logs, open voting) increased trust and reduced disputes.
- **Token diversity** (GEN, SAP, SCQ) allowed for nuanced governance but added complexity.
- **Feedback channels** (in-app, Discord) surfaced edge cases and improved proposal quality.
- **Onboarding new voters** was critical: clear guides and reminders boosted turnout.

## Supporting Data
- See [`/data/governance-logs-2024.json`](../data/governance-logs-2024.json) for anonymized proposal/voting logs.

## Recommendations for DAOs
- Use public, immutable logs for all governance actions.
- Provide onboarding for new voters and proposal submitters.
- Regularly review and iterate on governance processes based on feedback.
