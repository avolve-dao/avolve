# GEN — Supercivilization

The GEN token represents the ecosystem journey and the holistic vision of Avolve: the transition from "Degen" (zero-sum, anticivilization) to "Regen" (positive-sum, supercivilization). This paper synthesizes the foundational philosophy, onboarding approach, and the regenerative architecture of the platform.

## Ecosystem Vision

Avolve is designed to catalyze a civilization-level transformation, empowering individuals and collectives to co-create a regenerative future. The GEN layer encompasses all pillars and tokens, serving as the gateway to the Supercivilization.

## Onboarding as Transformation

Onboarding is not just an entry point—it is the first step in the journey from Degen to Regen. The "Magnetic Onboarding" experiment demonstrated that:

- Personalization, gamification, and real-time feedback dramatically increase engagement and satisfaction.
- Micro-interactions (confetti, toasts, progress bars) and mobile-first design are critical for delight and accessibility.
- Onboarding is a living experiment: feedback and rapid iteration are core to Avolve's approach.

**Key Metrics from the Magnetic Onboarding Experiment:**
| Metric | Classic Onboarding | Magnetic Onboarding |
|------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Completion Rate | 68% | 91% |
| Median Time to First Action | 2.6 days | 0.9 days |
| NPS (post-onboarding) | +11 | +54 |
| Qualitative Feedback | "Confusing" | "Fun, clear, motivating!" |

## The GEN Token's Role

- Anchors the platform's regenerative values
- Connects all sub-tokens and journeys (individual, collective, ecosystem)
- Is the foundation for access, governance, and participation across Avolve
