## Avolve Platform Overview

Avolve is built around three main value pillars:

1. **Superachiever** - For the individual journey of transformation
2. **Superachievers** - For collective journey of transformation
3. **Supercivilization** - For the ecosystem journey of transformation

### Platform Structure

The platform has a hierarchical structure with multiple components and tokens:

- **Supercivilization** (GEN token) - Avolve from Degen to Regen
  - Genius ID
  - GEN coin/token
  - Genie AI

- **Superachiever** (SAP token) - Create Your Success Puzzle
  - Personal Success Puzzle (PSP token)
  - Business Success Puzzle (BSP token)
  - Supermind Superpowers (SMS token)

- **Superachievers** (SCQ token) - Co-Create Your Superpuzzle
  - Superpuzzle Developments (SPD token)
  - Superhuman Enhancements (SHE token)
  - Supersociety Advancements (SSA token)
  - Supergenius Breakthroughs (SBG token)

This complex structure requires a sophisticated security system with role-based access control, audit logging, and token-based permissions.

### Token Hierarchy Visualization

The token structure follows a nested hierarchy that can be visualized as concentric circles:

```
┌─────────────────────────── GEN (Supercivilization) ───────────────────────────┐
│                                                                               │
│   ┌─────── SAP (Superachiever) ──────┐     ┌─────── SCQ (Superachievers) ─────┐   │
│   │                                  │     │                                  │   │
│   │   ┌─── PSP ───┐  ┌─── BSP ───┐   │     │   ┌─── SPD ───┐  ┌─── SHE ───┐   │   │
│   │   │ Personal  │  │ Business  │   │     │   │Superpuzzle│  │Superhuman │   │   │

│   │        ┌────── SMS ─────┐        │     │   ┌─── SSA ───┐  ┌─── SGB ───┐   │   │

│   │        │   Superpowers  │        │     │   │Advancement │ │Breakthrough│  │   │
│   │        └────────────────┘        │     │   └───────────┘  └───────────┘   │   │
│   │                                  │     │                                  │   │
│   └──────────────────────────────────┘     └──────────────────────────────────┘   │
│                                                                               │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This visualization illustrates how:
1. GEN is the largest all-encompassing token
2. SAP and SCQ are both contained within GEN
3. Within SAP are the PSP, BSP, and SMS tokens
4. Within SCQ are the SPD, SHE, SSA, and SGB tokens

Each token provides access to specific platform features and represents different aspects of the user's journey through individual and collective transformation.

### Blockchain and Decentralization Strategy

Avolve's long-term vision integrates concepts from:

1. **Network State** - Building a digital-first community with shared purpose and values
2. **Fractally DAO** - Implementing consensus-based governance and decision-making
3. **Psibase Blockchain** - Providing the technical infrastructure for decentralized operations

Our implementation strategy follows a phased approach:
- **Current Phase**: Centralized implementation using Supabase for immediate value delivery
- **Future Phase**: Gradual migration to Psibase blockchain for decentralized operations

This dual approach allows us to deliver value immediately while preparing for a more decentralized future.

## Recent Tokenomics Adjustments (Fractally Alignment)

To further align with Fractally principles emphasizing contribution and dynamic systems over fixed, potentially speculative mechanics, the following adjustments have been implemented (as of April 2025):

- **Removal of Peer-to-Peer Transfer Fees:** Token transfers between users no longer incur a fee, simplifying the internal economy and encouraging interaction.
- **Removal of Fixed `total_supply`:** The concept of a predefined, fixed total supply for tokens has been removed from the core `tokens` table. This allows for more flexible and dynamic supply models (e.g., inflation based on contribution, programmatic minting/burning) better suited to a Fractally-inspired ecosystem, rather than enforcing artificial scarcity.

These changes streamline the token system, focusing on utility, earning through contribution (minting), and consumption (burning) rather than transactional friction or fixed limits.
