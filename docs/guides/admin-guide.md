The onboarding dashboard provides a comprehensive, accessible overview of all users' onboarding progress. Admins can:

- **Filter** users by onboarding step, role, and completion status.
- **Sort** users by any column (email, name, role, date joined, current step, completed steps, completed at).
- **Send onboarding reminders** directly from the dashboard (see the Actions column).
- **Keyboard navigation**: All filters, table headers, and action buttons are accessible via keyboard. Use Tab/Shift+Tab to move between controls and Enter to activate.
- **Screen reader support**: All controls and table headers have descriptive ARIA labels and roles. Status changes are announced for assistive technologies.
- **Tooltips and inline help**: Filters and actions provide tooltips for clarity.

### Accessibility Standards

- Visible focus indicators on all interactive elements.
- ARIA roles and labels for all controls and table headers.
- Live region announcements for errors and status updates.
- High color contrast for text and controls.
- All dashboard controls, filters, and tables comply with WCAG 2.2 AA standards.
- Keyboard navigation is fully supported (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space, Esc).
- ARIA roles and labels are present for all interactive elements, tables, and modals.
- Color contrast meets or exceeds recommended ratios for text and controls.
