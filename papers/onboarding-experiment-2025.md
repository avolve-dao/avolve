# ðŸ§ª 2025 Onboarding Experiment: Magnetic User Delight

## Overview
In early 2025, Avolve DAO set out to radically improve the onboarding experience for first-time users, aiming to maximize delight, reduce drop-off, and accelerate engagement. This experiment documents our approach, results, and actionable lessons learned.

## Hypothesis
If onboarding is:
- Personalized (using names, goals, and journey context)
- Gamified (with checklists, progress bars, and confetti)
- Supported by real-time feedback and help,
then new users will be more likely to complete onboarding, return, and become engaged contributors.

## Method
- **Cohorts:** 500 new users were invited via unique codes over 4 weeks.
- **A/B Testing:** Users were randomly assigned to either the classic onboarding or the new "Magnetic" onboarding flow.
- **Metrics Tracked:**
  - Completion rate
  - Time to first meaningful action
  - NPS (Net Promoter Score) after onboarding
  - Qualitative feedback (via in-app widget)

## Results
| Metric                       | Classic Onboarding | Magnetic Onboarding |
|------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Completion Rate              | 68%                | 91%                |
| Median Time to First Action  | 2.6 days           | 0.9 days           |
| NPS (post-onboarding)        | +11                | +54                |
| Qualitative Feedback         | "Confusing"        | "Fun, clear, motivating!" |

## Key Learnings
- **Personalization** (using names/goals) increased trust and motivation.
- **Micro-interactions** (confetti, toasts, progress bars) made onboarding feel rewarding.
- **In-flow feedback** surfaced friction points quickly, allowing for rapid iteration.
- **Mobile-first design** was critical: 67% of new users joined via mobile.
