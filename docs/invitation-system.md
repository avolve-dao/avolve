   - Either upload a CSV file or enter a list of emails
   - Set expiration date and usage limit
   - Click "Create Invitations"

### Managing Invitations

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

The invitation system uses the following tables:

- `invitations`: Stores invitation codes and their metadata
- `invitation_requests`: Stores waitlist requests
- `metrics`: Tracks invitation-related events

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/invitations/create`: Creates a new invitation
- `POST /api/invitations/bulk`: Creates multiple invitations
- `POST /api/invitations/claim`: Claims an invitation code
- `POST /api/invitations/request`: Submits a waitlist request
- `GET /api/invitations/validate`: Validates an invitation code

### Functions

- `create_invitation()`: Creates a new invitation code
- `claim_invitation()`: Claims an invitation code
- `validate_invitation_code()`: Checks if a code is valid

## Metrics and Analytics

The invitation system tracks the following metrics:

- **Invitation Creation Rate**: How many invitations are created over time
- **Invitation Claim Rate**: How many invitations are claimed over time
- **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of invitations that lead to signups
- **Waitlist Growth**: How many people join the waitlist over time

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Invalid Invitation Code**:

   - Check if the code has already been used
   - Verify the code hasn't expired
   - Ensure the code was entered correctly (case-sensitive)

2. **Email Delivery Problems**:

   - Check spam/junk folders
   - Verify email address is correct
   - Check email service logs for delivery issues

3. **Bulk Upload Failures**:
   - Ensure CSV format is correct
   - Check for duplicate emails
   - Verify file size is within limits

## Best Practices

1. **Invitation Strategy**:

   - Start with a small batch of invitations to test the system
   - Gradually increase invitation volume as the platform stabilizes
   - Target specific user segments for initial invitations

2. **Waitlist Management**:

   - Respond to waitlist requests promptly
   - Set clear expectations about invitation timing
   - Use waitlist data to identify high-value potential users

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regularly review invitation metrics
   - Watch for unusual patterns that might indicate abuse
   - Adjust invitation strategy based on conversion data
