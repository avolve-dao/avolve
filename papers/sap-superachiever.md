# SAP — Superachiever

The SAP token represents the individual journey of transformation on Avolve. This paper explores the personal empowerment, growth, and success puzzle framework that enables users to become Superachievers.

## Individual Journey

Avolve empowers each user to create their own Personal and Business Success Puzzles, unlocking greater health, wealth, and fulfillment. The SAP layer is the bridge between the ecosystem vision (GEN) and the practical, personal experience.

### Personal Success Puzzle (PSP)

- Health & Energy
- Wealth & Career
- Peace & People

### Business Success Puzzle (BSP)

- Front-Stage Users
- Back-Stage Admin
- Bottom-Line Profit

### Supermind Superpowers (SMS)

- Current → Desired (starting)
- Desired → Actions (focusing)
- Actions → Results (finishing)

## Onboarding & Engagement

The onboarding experience for individuals is designed to be:

- Personalized: Names, goals, and context matter.
- Gamified: Checklists, progress bars, and micro-rewards.
- Transformative: The journey from Degen to Regen begins here.

## The SAP Token's Role

- Grants access to personal and business transformation tools
- Tracks and rewards individual progress and contributions
